# Furniture Shopping Application (Expo)

## Project Description
I developed a furniture shopping application using Expo to provide users with a convenient platform for browsing and purchasing furniture items. The application enables users to explore a wide range of furniture products, add items to their cart, and complete orders seamlessly.

## Key Features
1. **User Authentication:** Implemented user authentication functionality to allow users to register, log in, and securely access their accounts. User authentication ensures data security and personalized shopping experiences.
   
2. **Product Management:** Created CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing furniture products. Users can browse through a diverse catalog of furniture items, view detailed product information, and add products to their cart for purchase.
   
3. **Cart Management:** Developed cart management features to enable users to add and remove products from their shopping cart. Users can review their cart contents, update quantities, and proceed to checkout to complete their orders.
   
4. **Order Processing:** Implemented order processing functionality to facilitate seamless order placement and fulfillment. Users can review order details, select payment and shipping options, and confirm their purchases with a secure checkout process.
   
5. **Responsive Design:** Designed a responsive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure optimal viewing experiences across different screen sizes and devices. The application adapts dynamically to varying screen resolutions, providing a consistent and user-friendly interface.
   
6. **Database Integration:** Utilized MongoDB as the database management system to store and manage product, user, and order data. Leveraged MongoDB's flexibility and scalability to handle large volumes of data and support real-time interactions.
   
7. **Expo Framework:** Developed the application using Expo, a platform for building cross-platform applications using JavaScript and React Native. Expo provides a suite of tools and libraries for developing, testing, and deploying mobile applications with ease.
